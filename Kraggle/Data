Dataset Description
The objective of this challenge is to arrange Christmas tree toys into the smallest packing arrangement possible—as defined by the size of a square bounding box around the trees—for toy counts of 1-200.

Files

sample_submission.csv - a sample submission in the correct format

id - a combination of the n-tree count for the puzzle and the individual tree index within the puzzle
x, y - the 2-d coordinates of the tree; this point is defined at the center of the top of the trunk
deg - the rotation angle of the tree
This Getting Started Notebook implements a basic greedy algorithm (which was used to construct the sample_submission.csv), demonstrates collision detection, and provides a visualization function.

Note: The metric for this competition has been designed to reasonably maximize floating point precision during calculations, but cannot guarantee precision beyond what is displayed on the leaderboard.
